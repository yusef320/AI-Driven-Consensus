# AI-Driven-Consensus
This repository contains Python scripts to simulate multi-agent consensus dynamics with long-range interactions using path-Laplacian matrices. It provides synthetic data generation and predictive modeling (XGBoost, LSTM, Extended-LSTM, Transformer, ConvLSTM) for Erdős–Rényi, Watts–Strogatz, and Barabási–Albert directed network structures.
